# OctoAcme Project Management Overview

## Purpose
Provide a concise, shareable introduction to how OctoAcme runs projects so new teammates can quickly understand our approach, roles, and key artifacts.

## Scope
Applies to all cross-functional projects that deliver product features, services, or integrations.

## Principles
- Customer-first: prioritize customer value and usability.
- Iterative delivery: deliver small, testable increments.
- Clear ownership: each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead.
- Data-informed decisions: measure impact and iterate based on evidence.
- Psychological safety: encourage feedback and learning.

## Core Roles

### Delivery Team
- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, communications
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates agile ceremonies, removes impediments, coaches team
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, measures success
- **Business Analyst (BA)**: Bridges business needs and technical solutions, documents requirements
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design and testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria

### Specialized Roles

## Lifecycle (high-level)

5. Close & Retrospective: capture learnings and next steps.

## Communication Cadence
- Weekly sync between PM + PdM
- Twice-weekly standups for delivery team (or as agreed)

## How to use these docs
